This directory contains general purpose, web oriented,
and computational biology oriented modules,  as well
as some less general stuff associated with the Intronerator
web site.  Initially this library was created by Jim
Kent from 1999 to 2001.  Since then other programmers have
also added to it.  Jim continues to make substantial
contributions.

With the exception of the gifcomp.c module, all 
modules here are free for all use - public, private,
or commercial. The gifcomp.c module contains code
originally distributed by CompuServe under a similar
"free for all" license.  However this uses the LZW
patented by UniSys, which UniSys started enforcing
several years after CompuServe released this module.
The last I heard UniSys did not require a license
for non-commercial purposes, but did require a
license for commercial purposes. This may change
in the future, though the patent is nearing it's
expiration date in any case.  Commercial users
are advised to either get a license for LZW, or
to switch from GIF to PNG.
