when the query file format is fasta, you can specify many threads to process
it. It can reduce run time linearly, and use almost equal memory as the
original blat program. This is useful when you blat a big query file to a
huge reference like human whole genome sequence.


The program is based on the original blat program which was written by
Jim Kent.
